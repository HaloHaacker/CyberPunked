        <h1>The Three Methods of Making a Character</h1>
        <p>In Cyberpunk RED, there are three ways to generate your Character. Streetrat
            (Templates), Edgerunners (Fast and Dirty), and The Complete Package
            (Calculated). Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.</p>

            <h2><a href="tempHtml" target="_blank" style="color: black; text-decoration: none;">Streetrate (Templates):</a></h2>
            <p>If you've never roleplayed before or just want to get going
                without a lot of fuss, Templates are the fastest way to start creating a Character. But
                don't underestimate Templates! In the hands of an experienced roleplayer, even a template can be modified to make a unique and fully fleshed-out Character by expanding
                on the basics. By adding as you play, the Template gathers more individuality to itself,
                getting better and better the more you play.</p>

            <p>As you'll soon realize, the Cyberpunk RED
                Character Generation system is designed to give you a lot of flexibility. You can tailor
                the Character the way you want it, with lots of personal touches all through the process.
                But when you need to create a Character quickly and without a lot of painstaking
                detail, the Fast and Dirty method is an excellent option.</p>

            <h2><a href="tempHtml" target="_blank" style="color: black; text-decoration: none;">Complete Packages (Calculated):</a></h2>
            <p>The Calculated method is by far the most
                complex way to make a Cyberpunk RED Character. Yet the reward is the ability to
                create a Character that is exactly what you want, using pools of points to buy Statistics
                and Skills and starting money to buy weapons, armor, gear, and cyberware.</p>
