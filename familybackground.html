Hunger, fear, and the cold were constant companions, and the identity of your real parents was likely a mystery. Your education came from the gang, focusing on survival skills—fighting, killing, and stealing. Anything else was irrelevant.</td>

While hunger was an occasional concern, you usually managed to find food and a place to sleep. Your education was home-based, shaped by the challenges of your environment.</td>

                    <td>Your "home" consisted of cars, dumpsters, or abandoned shipping modules—if you were lucky enough to find shelter at all. Hunger, cold, and fear were constant companions unless you were strong or cunning enough to fight for scraps. Your education came from the harsh lessons of survival in the School of Hard Knocks.</td>

Education, if any, came from better-educated warren dwellers or a local Corporation that might have set up a small school.</td>
